# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
These are projects and notes as I go through Software Developer Paul Hudson's course,
100 Days of SwiftUI (https://github.com/evantilley/100DaysOfSwiftUI.git) in an effort
to get a thorough understanding of SwiftUI.
Days 1-12 are notes in Playground and subsequent days are projects in xCode.
